By 'linear matrix analysis' I mean analyzing or solving the equation Ax = b where A is some matrix and x,b are vectors. Such a general equation is so often encountered in linear algebra and data analysis, and I spent a reasonable amount of time programming the various techniques, that it is worthy of its own repository. 

- solver.py file will tell you if the system is linearly dependent, independent, or has not solution.
- span_space_test.py file will test a set of vectors and tell you if they span the space. 
- Poly_min.py will give the minimum polynomial of a matrix.

What I'm currently working on finishing is Jordan matrix analysis. The Jordan form of a matrix is an extremely fundamental and powerful conceptin linear algebra (and consequently data analysis). It also happens to be extremely fundamental to quantum mechanical theory - a thing you'd think entirely unrelated to data analysis and quantitative trading, but that is only what I want you to think.
